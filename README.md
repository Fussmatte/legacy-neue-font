# Legacy Neue
An 8x8 pixel font with glyphs from Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement

### What/why the heck is Symbols for Legacy Computing
Basically it's a [Unicode block](https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1FB00.pdf) containing myriad glyphs from really old computers. The current standard (as of April 2022) was adopted in 2020, but [a Supplement has been proposed](https://retrocomputingforum.com/t/more-legacy-microcomputer-and-teletext-characters-approved-for-unicode/2363) and is expected to be included in future versions of Unicode, so technically this font is based on a Unicode block that hasn't been finalised and MIGHT break in the future. But hey im not gonna let it go to waste and just forget about it til then so here it is.

I made this font because holy crap Unicode officially has Pacman in it. Also all those other cool glyphs. I think it'd be cool for text art and other stuff. As far as I know it's the only font right now that supports these characters ([or maybe not](https://www.masswerk.at/char8/)), which is kind of understandable because of all that stuff I just said in the other paragraph

whatever, it's for fun

### How can I use this?
This font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (see the [license file](LICENSE)).
Credit to me (Reese Rivers) would be appreciated though.

### Did you just remember you had this and uploaded the files here kind of haphazardly
Yes
