An 8x8 pixel font with glyphs from Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement.

I thought it would be fun and maybe useful for fun computer stuff like text art.

## How can I use this?
However, though credit to me (Reese Rivers) would be nice. actual license is a wip

## Is this repo actually complete
